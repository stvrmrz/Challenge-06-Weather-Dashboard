<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Weather Dashboard Demo

![Project Blog Post Demo](/assets/weatherDashboardDemo.gif)

This project was about creating a weather dashboard application that fetches data from a third party API. By making a request with specific parameters to a URL, we are able to extract the weather data we want to pull from the 5 Day Weather Forecast API.

Here's why we're doing this:
* This utilizes a lot of what we learned so far in our bootcamp like local storage, APIs, and event listeners, etc.
* Deeper experience with APIs and how we use our API keys to fetch the data.
* Learn how to store data from third party API to local storage and actually use them for something interesting.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
- [x] WHEN I search for a city
      THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
- [x] WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
      THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
- [x] WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
      THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
- [x] WHEN I click on a city in the search history
      THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
